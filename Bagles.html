<h1>All about Bagels</h1>
<img src="bagel2.jpg">
<p>origins are deeply rooted in the Jewish communities of Eastern Europe, particularly Poland. As Jewish communities migrated to different parts of the world, they carried their culinary</p>
<p> traditions with them,<i> including the beloved bagel.</i> In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Jewish immigrants brought bagels to the United States, where they became a staple</p>
<p> of Jewish-American cuisine.</p>
